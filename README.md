## 📘 Overview

This project is a **Flutter + Firebase learning app** created to understand how Firebase integrates with Flutter for building full-featured mobile applications.  

It covers **Authentication**, **Realtime Database**, **Firestore**, and **Storage** with hands-on **CRUD operations**.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

### 🔑 Firebase Authentication
- Sign up and sign in with **Email & Password**
- **Phone number login** using OTP verification
- **Forget password** feature for email reset
- Managed user sessions with `FirebaseAuth`

---

### 💾 Firebase Realtime Database
- Learned how to store and sync data in **real time**
- Understood JSON-based storage structure
- Implemented CRUD operations:
  - `set()` → Create/Update data  
  - `get()` / `onValue()` → Read data  
  - `update()` → Partial update  
  - `remove()` → Delete data  
- Ideal for chat apps and instant data updates

---

### 📂 Firebase Cloud Firestore
- Worked with **Collections** and **Documents**
- Used real-time **snapshots** for live updates
- Implemented CRUD operations:
  - `.add()` → Create  
  - `.get()` / `.snapshots()` → Read  
  - `.update()` → Update  
  - `.delete()` → Delete  
- Practiced advanced queries and structured data handling

---

### 🖼️ Firebase Storage
- Uploaded and retrieved **images & files**
- Managed user profile photos and media content
- Integrated with Firestore to link stored files

---

## 🛠️ Firebase Tools & Packages Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **FirebaseAuth** | User Authentication |
| **FirebaseDatabase** | Real-time JSON-based storage |
| **FirebaseFirestore** | Structured collections & documents |
| **FirebaseStorage** | Upload and manage media/files |

---

## ⚙️ App Functionalities

✅ User Authentication (Email/Password & Phone Login)  
✅ Forgot Password (Email reset)  
✅ Firestore CRUD Operations  
✅ Realtime Database CRUD Operations  
✅ File Upload using Firebase Storage  
✅ Toast messages and UI feedback  

---

## 🧩 Key Learnings

- Difference between **Realtime Database** and **Firestore**:
  | Realtime Database | Firestore |
  |------------------|-----------|
  | JSON Tree structure | Collection–Document structure |
  | Best for real-time sync | Best for scalable structured data |
  | Simple and lightweight | Powerful queries and indexing |

- How to use **snapshots** for live data updates  
- How to integrate and configure Firebase in a Flutter project  
- Data validation, authentication handling, and navigation flow

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Flutter (Dart)  
- **Backend:** Firebase  
- **Database:** Realtime Database & Cloud Firestore  
- **Storage:** Firebase Storage  
- **Auth:** Firebase Authentication  

---

## 🎯 Outcome

By completing this project, I learned:
- Full Firebase integration in Flutter
